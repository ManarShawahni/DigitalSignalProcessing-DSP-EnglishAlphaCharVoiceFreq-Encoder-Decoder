# Digital Signal Processing-EnglishAlphaCharVoiceFreq-Encoder-Decoder

## Overview
This project focuses on encoding and decoding text into audio signals using Python and Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques like Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and bandpass filtering.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To map English alphabet characters to unique voice-frequency combinations.
- To generate audio signals for each character.
- To decode audio signals back to text using FFT and bandpass filtering.

## languauge Used
The project extensively uses Python languague.

## Procedure
The project is divided into two phases with GUI:
- Phase One covers the creation of a frequency mapping technique and the generation of audio signals for each character.
- Phase Two focuses on using FFT and bandpass filtering for decoding audio signals back to text.

The results are tested for the system's accuracy and efficiency, finding FFT to be faster than bandpass filtering in decoding audio signals.
